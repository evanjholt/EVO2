- [x] Clean up CLAUDE.md to workflow and current pipeline only  
- [x] Update SUPABASE_SETUP.md to remove outdated info
- [x] Create organized docs/ structure
- [x] Create fresh tasks/todo.md for current tasks

### Review
**Memory files reorganized successfully:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Clean workflow and current development pipeline
- `docs/setup.md` - Updated local development setup documentation
- `docs/etl.md` - ETL script documentation
- `docs/archive/historical_tasks.md` - Historical task information
- `docs/README.md` - Documentation overview

**Result:** Clear, organized memory structure with current information only.

## Data Upload to Supabase ✅

### Completed
- [x] Run the ETL script to download and process Canadian lobbying data
- [x] Monitor the data loading process and handle any issues
- [x] Verify the data was loaded successfully into the Registration_PrimaryExport table
- [x] Check data quality and provide summary statistics

### Review
**Data upload completed successfully:**
- **Records loaded:** 25,199 Canadian lobbying registrations (filtered from 157,837 total)
- **Date range:** July 10, 2023 to July 4, 2025 (last 2 years)
- **Registration types:** 
  - Type 1: 17,359 records (68.9%)
  - Type 3: 4,726 records (18.8%)
  - Type 2: 3,114 records (12.4%)
- **Top lobbying firms by registration count:**
  - Crestview Strategy: 750 registrations
  - PAA Advisory | Conseils: 739 registrations
  - Sandstone Group: 707 registrations
  - StrategyCorp Inc.: 678 registrations
- **Data quality:** All 15 target columns loaded successfully
- **Performance:** ETL completed in ~49 seconds using PostgreSQL executemany

**Issues resolved:**
- Fixed bug in `filter_recent_rows` generator function that was preventing data yielding
- Replaced ineffective `copy` method with `executemany` for psycopg3 compatibility
- Ensured proper transaction handling and data persistence

**Result:** Canadian lobbying data successfully uploaded to local Supabase Registration_PrimaryExport table with proper filtering and quality checks.

## Table Rename to Registration_PrimaryExport ✅

### Completed
- [x] Update database migration file to create 'Registration_PrimaryExport' table instead of 'lobby_staging'
- [x] Update main ETL script with new table name in all SQL operations
- [x] Update debug scripts to use new table name
- [x] Update documentation files to reflect new table name
- [x] Test the changes by running the ETL script

### Review
**Table rename completed successfully:**
- **Table name changed:** `lobby_staging` → `"Registration_PrimaryExport"`
- **Files updated:** 10 files with ~25 references
- **Database schema:** Updated migration file with proper quoted identifiers
- **ETL script:** All SQL operations updated to use new table name
- **Debug scripts:** 4 debug files updated for consistency
- **Documentation:** All docs updated to reflect new table name
- **Testing:** ETL script runs successfully with new table name

**Technical details:**
- Used quoted identifiers (`"Registration_PrimaryExport"`) for PostgreSQL case-sensitivity
- Updated all index names to match new table naming convention
- Maintained data integrity throughout the rename process

**Result:** Successfully renamed table from `lobby_staging` to `"Registration_PrimaryExport"` with all code and documentation updated accordingly.

## Code Cleanup and Optimization ✅

### Completed
- [x] Remove unused imports (io, Path)
- [x] Move psycopg.sql imports to top of file
- [x] Add constants for magic numbers (BATCH_SIZE, DAYS_BACK)
- [x] Remove verbose debug print statements
- [x] Refactor encoding detection into helper function
- [x] Improve error handling consistency
- [x] Clean up code formatting and structure

### Review
**Code cleanup completed successfully:**
- **Removed unused imports:** Cleaned up `io` and `Path` imports that were no longer needed
- **Reorganized imports:** Moved `psycopg.sql` imports to top of file for better organization
- **Added constants:** Created `BATCH_SIZE = 1000` and `DAYS_BACK = 730` constants for maintainability
- **Reduced verbosity:** Removed excessive debug print statements for cleaner output
- **Refactored encoding detection:** Created `detect_file_encoding()` helper function to eliminate code duplication
- **Improved error handling:** Made error handling more consistent throughout the script
- **Enhanced code structure:** Better organization and formatting throughout

**Technical improvements:**
- DRY principle applied to encoding detection logic
- Constants improve code maintainability
- Cleaner output with reduced verbosity
- Better separation of concerns with helper functions
- More consistent error handling patterns

**Result:** Clean, maintainable ETL script with improved organization and reduced technical debt. Script continues to work correctly with all 25,199 records loading successfully.
