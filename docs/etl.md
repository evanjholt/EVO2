## Data Schema

The script automatically converts all column names to `snake_case` format and creates a staging table with TEXT columns for all fields. Common columns include:

- `registration_number`
- `client_name`
- `lobbyist_name`
- `registration_date`
- `termination_date`
- `subject_matter`
- `government_institution`

## Notes

- Data is filtered to include only registrations from the last 2 years
- All columns are stored as TEXT in the staging table for flexibility
- The script handles various date formats automatically
- Temporary files are cleaned up after processing
- Uses streaming upload to handle large datasets efficiently
