## Standard Workflow
1. **Plan first**  
   • Think through the problem.  
   • Write a *Plan* section to `tasks/todo.md` using markdown check-boxes (`- [ ] task`).  
2. **Pause for approval** – wait until Evan gives the OK.  
3. **Execute** one task at a time, replacing `[ ]` with `[x]` as each finishes.  
4. **After every task**: reply with a high-level summary of the change.  
5. **Keep it simple** – smallest viable change, minimal blast radius.  
6. **When all tasks are complete**: append a *Review* section to `tasks/todo.md` summarising what changed and anything notable.
